# for student app
we just need the deployment and service 
Service exposes the app to other systems to access
LoadBalancer-> exposes the service to external systems
ClusterIp-> the app will just be accessible within the cluster( default one to be used by K8s when you dont specify)
NodePort
ExternalIP
# for mongo db
There exists a Kubernetes resource that allows obtaining persistent storage volume: the PersistentVolumeClaim.
This storage must not be affected by whatever happens to the MongoDB Pod.
If the MongoDB Pod is deleted, the storage must persist â€” if the MongoDB Pod is moved to another node, the storage must persist.
we need to configure:
   PersistentVolumeClaim
   Service
   Deployment


And /data/db is where MongoDB saves its data.
It is mongodb://mongo:27017/dev.
The hostname is mongo.


CHECK IF CLUSTER IS UP -> minikube status

you can do deployment all at once as all the yml are on the same folder -> kubectl apply -f kube
or individual deployment -> kubectl apply student.yml    then   kubectl apply mongo.yml

##################  to watch the pods
kubectl get pods --watch

####### access service and prints the url 
minikube service student --url

this is the url you should use to open in browser or postman

# ### to scale deployment to 2 pods
kubectl scale --replicas=2 deployment/student
kubectl get pods -l app=student --watch
minikube service student --url
